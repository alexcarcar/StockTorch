# 📊 Stock Trading Simulator in Python

Welcome to the Stock Trading Simulator — a beginner-friendly Python project that teaches the basics of stock trading through simulation and strategy. Whether you're curious about how stock prices move or want to experiment with simple trading logic, this project is a great place to start!

## 🚀 Features

- 📈 Simulates daily stock price fluctuations
- 💰 Manages a virtual portfolio with buy/sell actions
- 🧠 Implements a basic trading strategy
- 📊 Visualizes stock price trends over time
- 🛠️ Easy to customize and extend

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- How stock prices can change over time
- How to evaluate and manage a portfolio
- Basic trading strategies (buy low, sell high)
- How to visualize financial data using `matplotlib`

## 🐍 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `matplotlib` library

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
stock-trading-simulator/
│
├── simulator.py       # Main simulation script
├── README.md          # Project overview and instructions
```

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or copy the code into a file named `simulator.py`.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python simulator.py
```

3. Watch the simulation unfold and view the final stock price chart.

## 📈 Strategy Overview

This simulator uses a simple strategy:
- Buy 1 share if the stock price drops from the previous day.
- Sell 1 share if the stock price rises from the previous day.

You can modify this logic to test other strategies like moving averages, momentum, or even machine learning!

## 🧩 Customization Ideas

- Add more stocks or real-time data using APIs like Yahoo Finance or Alpaca
- Implement advanced strategies (e.g., RSI, MACD)
- Track performance metrics (e.g., ROI, Sharpe ratio)
- Save results to a file or dashboard
